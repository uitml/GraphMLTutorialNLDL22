# GraphMLTutorialNLDL22
Tutorial NLDL22: Introduction to Graph Machine Learning, with Jupyter notebooks

This tutorial takes place during the conference NLDL 2022, on the 10th of January 2022.
The tutorial is made of 3 parts of 30 min each.

## Part 1: Introduction to graphs with Python and Networkx

This part will go through the Jupyter notebooks [01_introduction_to_graphs.ipynb](https://github.com/uitml/GraphMLTutorialNLDL22/blob/main/01_introduction_to_graphs.ipynb) and [02_basic_graph_properties.ipynb](https://github.com/uitml/GraphMLTutorialNLDL22/blob/main/02_basic_graph_properties.ipynb).

## Part 2: Graph visualization using Gephi

The material for this part is available [here](https://github.com/mizvol/gephi-tutorials). The software [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is open source.

## Part 3: Graph Neural Networks
